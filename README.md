Personal budget / expenses app.

## Description

Used a mobile app for budgeting many years ago. I thought the back up worked. I backed up once in a while.

One day, my phone crashed. Turns out, the back up never worked. When I tried to import the back up file, it was empty.

Yes, I'm looking at you, daily expenses 2 app. From that day, I never used such apps again. Back to manual for me.

Now, I believe I am decent enough to build my very own functional app from scratch doing what I want to do.

No rubbish. No ads. And the app can send the data as a CSV to my email.

### Accessing the Application

Developing with flutter means that this app technically works with multiple OS.

Windows, macOS, linux, android, iOS, yada yada.
But it's a personal app, and it's for personal use, so I won't go through the hassle of bringing it to Google playstore.

I'm also using the free version of firebase, and bringing it out to the masses might mean I have to scale things up and go for a paid version. I'm not sponsored, sorry.

I might limit the app and share it with a few other users, though any abuse of the app and I can rid the account muahaha...
